> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
> You are not defined by your past. You are <span class="highlight">prepared by your past.</span>
> <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>

<!-- .element: class="quote-source" -->

Note:
- to talk about where we are going, we must acknowledge where we have been and
  where we are now



### 2011
- Issue summary initiative
- IRC Office Hours
- Usage of “needs...” tags
- Spreadsheet to track attendance and skill level

Note:
- xjm (Jess) starts the Issue summary initiative.
- catch (Nathaniel) with xjm support starts the IRC Office hours to do triaging.
- Usage of “needs...” tags starts to get more used thanks to Office Hours



### 2012
- First contributor tasks document
- First DrupalCon sprint day
- Live commit
- drupalmentoring.org

Note:
- jhodgdon (Jennifer) creates first contributor tasks document as central place for people
  to find out how they could contribute to Drupal.
- DrupalCon Denver has the first Friday sprint called Core Office hours sprint,
  with two rooms, one general sprints and one mentored.
- There was a live commit from the first sprint.
- xjm builds drupalmentoring.org to build a community around it and where people
  could share attendance lists, tasks, mentors...



### 2013
- Drupal.org upgraded to D7
- Drupal.org upgrade broke drupalmentoring.org
- Contributors write comments with what they will do

Note:
- The upgrade removed the JSON feature, breaking drupalmentoring.org
- Before, the assigned field was used to indicate when people started writing
  code, and dm.o used for new contributors to say they were starting other tasks
- Now, needed a way to say "I'm starting on a task", and since many tasks
  assigned field not usable for that. (And, when an issue has someone assigned
  other people *will not* work on an issue (usually), even if it was assigned
  a long time ago, and that can block progress on an issue.)
- This change in behavior has many benefits, as it helps participants conquer
  their fear of making a comment early, while with a mentor *and* is more
  communicative and people can work on different tasks simultaneously. *and*
  it happens where the whole community can see it, not just on dm.o, allowing
  for less duplicate work, and more exposing of mentoring integrated into the
  normal workflow.



### 2014
- Dreditor remaining tasks template
- Mentor t-shirts
- Acquia Dev Desktop
- Contributor task cards

Note:
- Dreditor added the button to add the remaining tasks template.
- The 4th mentored strint happened in Portland and it was the first one where
  the DA provided mentored sprints.
- Acquia Dev Desktop, allowed people to quickly start contributing on the sprints.
- First appearance on Drupal South, NZ and refined over next Cons. Explain what
  The cards are.

<!-- .element: class="quote-source" -->

Note:
- What has happened in the past few months?



### Drupal Association support

Note:
At DrupalCons sprints and mentoring are linked. In Bogotá 2015:
- documented *all* of the sprint planning tasks
- DA staff began implementing sprint planning tasks for LA
- Financial support: sprint task cards, stickers, lunch, (more) signs, booth



### [groups.drupal.org/mentoring](http://groups.drupal.org/mentoring)

Note:
goal: make mentoring wisdom more distributed and the activities that are being
done more transparent
- announce monthly mentor meetings
- post meeting minutes
- address questions from mentors



### [drupal.org/project/mentoring](https://www.drupal.org/project/mentoring)

Note:
goal: having the todo lists discoverable and any d.o user able to comment, edit
and work on them without having to get permission in a separate system (google
docs, another site, trello)
- track tasks as issues
- use Plan issues for documenting overarching tasks and have conference-specfic issues
- track due dates



### Documentation
- [Mentoring at Drupal events](https://www.drupal.org/core-mentoring/mentoring-at-events)
- [Mentoring coordinator](https://www.drupal.org/core-mentoring/mentoring-coordinator)
- [Mentor lead responsibilities](https://www.drupal.org/core-mentoring/mentored-sprint-leads)

Note:
1. used at Mentor Orientation: dramatic reading to engage attendees
1. describe responsibilities: Sprint and Planning, Sprint Room, Booth, Communications, First Time Sprinter, Novice Issue Triage



### Integration with general sprint

Note:
- Los Angeles 2015, core commit happened around 2pm, earliest ever
- Core mentored sprint room emptied out, remaining first time contributors join
  general sprint room and continue their work together with experienced
  contributors and initiative leads



### Communications

Note:
- improved mentor communications using MailChimp starting with Bogota



### Word is out!

Note:
- Drupal success with getting new contributors involved and mentoring
- other open source projects interested and investigating drupal mentoring
  techniques

#### Moar automation

Note:
  - Mentor Leads have responsibilities that can be automated.
    Mentors have skills that would be better used on tasks that need thought.
    Use automation to free up the mentors to mentor, or do other process
    improvements.




### To accomplish the vision



##### Mentor MailChimp integration with events.drupal.org



##### 2572663
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2572663">Integrate Mentor sign-up with
MailChimp list</a>

Note:
  - Right now, after mentor fills out the drupalcon webform, and email gets sent
    and the mentor communication lead copy and pastes into mailchimp. There is
    api integration, let's use it.



##### Automate html list of mentors on events.drupal.org



##### 2239073
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2239073">Figure out how to automatically
generate list of mentors HTML</a>

Note:
  - Right now, the communication lead also copy and pastes out of that same
    email and manually edits the list of mentors. We have views, and there is
    no need to wait for "human approval" of mentors. Let's automate it.



#### Make it easier for people to find relevant first issues



##### 2332789
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2332789">Reduce Novice Contribution
differences and<br>
  consolidate novice contribution landing pages,<br> content, blocks</a>

Note:
  an issue to redesign and consolidate and remove duplicate docs
  <br>Dashboard
  <br>sidebar
  <br>Landing page



##### 1290740
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1290740">How to label, aggregate and expose
issues, docs, forum posts and groups to Topic pages</a>

Note:
  something



#### Have instructions on the issue for how to work on the issue



##### 2013222
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2013222">Add "Issue tasks" to project
issues and correlate tasks with handbook documentation</a>



##### 2193871
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2193871">Create an Action Block for Short
Messages for Users & Visitors</a>



#### Tell people which issue are workable



##### 2572061
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2572061">Add a dismissable notification
when somebody goes to a core issue while in RC</a>



#### New contributors can easily get and use tools



##### 2233509
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2233509">tools</a>

Note:
  - might have a "better" solution when bandwidth is not an issue.
    but need to consider ADD/native when wifi is a problem



#### Mentors who have not been to an in person event can start mentoring locally

Note:
  - Need more detailed, facilitator and lead, instructions.



### Mentors do more "real" mentoring
