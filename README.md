## Past
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->
> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
> You are not defined by your past. You are <span class="highlight">prepared by your past.</span>
> <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>
> <span>&mdash; Unknown</span>
<!-- .element: class="quote-source" -->

Note:
- to talk about where we are going, we must acknowledge where we have been and
  where we are now



## 2011
Note:
- several smaller initiatives put mentoring on the map as key part of the project



### Issue summary initiative

Note:
- d.o gets a new feature: editable issue summaries
- xjm (Jess) starts the Issue summary initiative



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/issue-summary.png" -->

Note:
- anyone can update the issue summary
- overview of the problem, steps to reproduce, screenshots, proposed resolution
- why? encourage contribution by increasing understanding of the issue



### IRC office hours



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/office-hours.png" -->

Note:
- catch (Nathaniel) with xjm support starts weekly IRC Office hours to do triaging
- regular time, online
- requires familiarity with IRC



### “Needs...” tags
Note:
- Various “needs...”tags existed prior to mentoring initiatives



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/needs-tags.png" -->

Note:
- Usage of “needs...” tags starts to get more used thanks to office hours
- tags identify a task that needs to be done
- once task is completed, remove tags



## 2012



### Contributor tasks

[drupal.org/contributor-tasks](http://www.drupal.org/contributor-tasks)

Note:
- jhodgdon (Jennifer) creates first contributor tasks document as central place for people
  to find out how they could contribute to Drupal.



### DrupalCon sprint day

Note:
- DrupalCon Denver has the first Friday sprint called Core Office hours sprint,
  with two rooms, one general sprints and one mentored.



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/live-commit.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo CC-BY Pedro Lozano https://flic.kr/p/y7SCeW" -->

Note:
- There was a live commit from the first sprint.
- Live commit is a fun and exciting activity that brings contributors together to talk about their roles and what they did to solve an issue
- Core committer reads and explains the patch, then commits the code changes to Drupal



### drupalmentoring.org

Note:
- xjm builds drupalmentoring.org to build a community around it and where people
  could share attendance lists, tasks, mentors...
- separate site form drupal.org, allowed for rapid development and customization



## 2013



### drupal.org upgrade

Note:
- Drupal.org upgrade broke drupalmentoring.org
- The upgrade removed the JSON feature, breaking drupalmentoring.org
  code, and dm.o used for new contributors to say they were starting other tasks



### Say it with words

Note:
- Before, the assigned field was used to indicate when people started writing
- Now, needed a way to say "I'm starting on a task", and since many tasks
  assigned field not usable for that. (And, when an issue has someone assigned
  other people *will not* work on an issue (usually), even if it was assigned
  a long time ago, and that can block progress on an issue.)




<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/say-it.png" -->
Note:
- This change in behavior has many benefits, as it helps participants conquer
  their fear of making a comment early, while with a mentor *and* is more
  communicative and people can work on different tasks simultaneously. *and*
  it happens where the whole community can see it, not just on dm.o, allowing
  for less duplicate work, and more exposing of mentoring integrated into the
  normal workflow.



## 2014



### T-shirts



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/mentor-tshirt.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo CC-BY Pedro Lozano https://flic.kr/p/yMhWKy" -->

Note:
- The 4th mentored strint happened in Portland and it was the first one where
  the DA provided T-shirts for mentors.
- Typically bright color, easy to spot T shirt.



### Remaining tasks template
Note:
- Dreditor added the button to add the remaining tasks template.



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/remaining-tasks.png" -->



### Tools

Note:
- Mentors in the past would help people set up dev environments,
  each was different.
- Brian Gilbert (realityloop) had a goal to pick some standard set of tools that were likely to work
  on a wide variety of machines and were good enough to get people started
  on a sprint day.
- Acquia Dev Desktop was not usable for that, for Drupal 8. Brian, and
  scor worked very closely with Acquia to get ADD beta ready for an upcoming sprint in time.
- Acquia Dev Desktop, allowed people to quickly start contributing on the sprints.



### Task cards



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/contributor-cards.jpg" -->
Note:
- First appearance on Drupal South, NZ and refined over next Cons.
- 5-7 cards with discrete tasks
- Explorer, Developer, Community Contributor, Documenter, Mentor
- tangible artifact, suggested paths



## Present
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->

> Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery.
> <span class="highlight">Today is a gift.</span>
> That’s why we call it the present.
> <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>
> <span>&mdash; Bil Keane</span>
<!-- .element: class="quote-source" -->

Note:
- What has happened in the past few months?




### Drupal Association support



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/sprint-food.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo CC-BY Josef Jerabek https://flic.kr/p/zhiCAT" -->

Note:
At DrupalCons sprints and mentoring are linked. In Bogotá 2015:
- documented *all* of the sprint planning tasks
- DA staff began implementing sprint planning tasks for LA
- Financial support: sprint task cards, stickers, lunch, (more) signs, booth
- DA provides DrupalCon tickets for experienced mentors



### [groups.drupal.org/mentoring](http://groups.drupal.org/mentoring)

Note:
goal: make mentoring wisdom more distributed and the activities that are being
done more transparent
- announce monthly mentor meetings
- post meeting minutes
- address questions from mentors



### [drupal.org/project/mentoring](https://www.drupal.org/project/mentoring)



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/mentoring-project.png" -->
Note:
goal: having the todo lists discoverable and any d.o user able to comment, edit
and work on them without having to get permission in a separate system (google
docs, another site, trello)
- track tasks as issues
- use Plan issues for documenting overarching tasks and have conference-specfic issues
- track due dates



### Documentation
- [Mentoring at Drupal events](https://www.drupal.org/core-mentoring/mentoring-at-events)
- [Mentoring coordinator](https://www.drupal.org/core-mentoring/mentoring-coordinator)
- [Mentor lead responsibilities](https://www.drupal.org/core-mentoring/mentored-sprint-leads)

Note:
1. child pages of drupal.org/core-mentoring
1. used at Mentor Orientation: dramatic reading to engage attendees
1. describe responsibilities: Sprint and Planning, Sprint Room, Booth, Communications, First Time Sprinter, Novice Issue Triage



### Integration with general sprint

Note:
- general sprint and mentored core sprint



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/mentoring.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo CC-BY Josef Jerabek https://flic.kr/p/yYWFWx" -->
Note:
- Los Angeles 2015, core commit happened around 2pm, earliest ever
- Core mentored sprint room emptied out, remaining first time contributors join
  general sprint room and continue their work together with experienced
  contributors and initiative leads



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/general-sprint.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo CC-BY Josef Jerabek https://flic.kr/p/ze9AHf" -->
Note:
- Goal is to integrate first time sprinters into the general sprint room



### Communications

Note:
- first used personal email, then a Google spreadsheet add-on
- improved mentor communications using MailChimp starting with Bogota
- reusable templates, scheduled emails



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/sprint-stickies.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo CC-BY Josef Jerabek https://flic.kr/p/y8a4gB" -->
Note:
- Continuous adaptation: using sticky notes to indicate need of assistance



<!-- .slide: data-background="custom/images/tshirt-tape.jpg" data-state="show-header" data-header="Photo CC-BY-SA Jared Smith https://flic.kr/p/rzSxLL" -->
Note:
- Another adaptation: decorating T-shirts with tape
- Promotes creativity, fun, team bonding



### Word is out!

Note:
- Drupal 7 had 900 contributors with commit mentions, Drupal 8 has over 3000
- Drupal success with getting new contributors involved and mentoring
- other open source projects like Docker are interested and investigating drupal mentoring
  techniques
- bodes well for future



## Vision of the future
<!-- .element: class="heading" -->
> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
> The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
> <i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i>
> <span>&mdash; Alan Kay</span>
<!-- .element: class="quote-source" -->

Note:
- reintroduce yourself
- coming up: 2015.. you mean we're in the future??
- generally describe vision



<!-- .slide: data-background-video="custom/2015-future.mp4" -->

Note:
- 2015... you mean we are in the future??



### To accomplish the vision



#### Moar automation

Note:
  - Mentor Leads have responsibilities that can be automated.
    Mentors have skills that would be better used on tasks that need thought.
    Use automation to free up the mentors to mentor, or do other process
    improvements.



##### Mentor MailChimp integration with events.drupal.org



##### 2572663
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2572663">Integrate Mentor sign-up with
MailChimp list</a>

Note:
  - Right now, after mentor fills out the drupalcon webform, and email gets sent
    and the mentor communication lead copy and pastes into mailchimp. There is
    api integration, let's use it.



##### Automate html list of mentors on events.drupal.org

Note:
- we recognize mentors by listing them on the core mentored sprint page on DrupalCon website
- also having a list of mentors, encourages new contributors to sign up



##### 2239073
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2239073">Figure out how to automatically
generate list of mentors HTML</a>

Note:
  - Right now, the communication lead also copy and pastes out of that same
    email and manually edits the list of mentors. We have views, and there is
    no need to wait for "human approval" of mentors. Let's automate it.



#### Make it easier for people to find relevant first issues



##### 2332789
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2332789">Reduce Novice Contribution
differences and<br>
  consolidate novice contribution landing pages,<br> content, blocks</a>

Note:
  an issue to redesign and consolidate and remove duplicate docs
  <br>Dashboard
  <br>sidebar
  <br>Landing page



##### 1290740
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1290740">How to label, aggregate and expose
issues, docs, forum posts and groups to Topic pages</a>

Note:
  something



#### Have instructions on the issue for how to work on the issue



##### 2013222
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2013222">Add "Issue tasks" to project
issues and correlate tasks with handbook documentation</a>



##### 2193871
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2193871">Create an Action Block for Short
Messages for Users & Visitors</a>



#### Tell people which issue are workable



##### 2572061
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2572061">Add a dismissable notification
when somebody goes to a core issue while in RC</a>



#### New contributors can easily get and use tools



##### 2233509
<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2233509">tools</a>

Note:
  - might have a "better" solution when bandwidth is not an issue.
    but need to consider ADD/native when wifi is a problem



#### Mentors who have not been to an in person event can start mentoring locally

Note:
  - Need more detailed, facilitator and lead, instructions.

Note: Conversation starters
- measures of success?
- "mentors should do real mentoring" - what does that look like?
